\i ai_insights_cleanup_fix.sql
\i ai_insights_final_fix.sql
```

### 2. Edge Function
Ensure your `generate-ai-insights` Edge Function is deployed with the updated code:

```typescript
// File: supabase/functions/generate-ai-insights/index.ts
// Use the generate-ai-insights-updated.ts version
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Set these in your Supabase Edge Function environment:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here  # Optional for email notifications
```

Make sure your `lib/supabase.ts` file is properly configured with your project URL and anon key.
