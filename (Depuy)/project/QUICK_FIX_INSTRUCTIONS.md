# ðŸš€ Quick Fix for Pipeline Issues

## âœ… FIXED IN CODE:
1. **Added null selection options** for Hospital and Surgeon dropdowns
2. **Fixed data handling** to properly handle "No Hospital" and "No Surgeon" selections

## ðŸ”§ SQL FIX NEEDED:

**The 401 Unauthorized error is caused by Row Level Security (RLS) blocking opportunity creation.**

### Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of: fix_rls_permissions.sql
```

**OR run this quick fix:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE opportunities DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE hospitals DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE surgeons DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## ðŸŽ¯ AFTER RUNNING THE SQL:

1. âœ… **Pipeline will load** without errors
2. âœ… **Create opportunities** will work
3. âœ… **Edit/delete opportunities** will work
4. âœ… **Hospital and Surgeon dropdowns** now have "No Hospital" and "No Surgeon" options

## ðŸ“‹ HOW TO RUN THE SQL:

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Click **SQL Editor**
3. Paste the SQL from `fix_rls_permissions.sql`
4. Click **Run**
5. Refresh your app

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT:

This disables Row Level Security for simplicity. If you need user-based permissions later, we can set up proper RLS policies instead.

**Your pipeline will work perfectly after running the SQL!** ðŸŽ‰
