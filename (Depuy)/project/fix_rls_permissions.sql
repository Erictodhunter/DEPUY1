-- Fix Row Level Security (RLS) permissions for opportunities table
-- This will allow users to create, read, update, and delete opportunities

-- First, check if RLS is enabled on opportunities table
-- If it is, we need to create policies or disable it

-- Option 1: Disable RLS completely (simplest solution)
ALTER TABLE opportunities DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Option 2: If you want to keep RLS enabled, create permissive policies
-- Uncomment the lines below if you prefer to keep RLS with policies

-- Enable RLS (if not already enabled)
-- ALTER TABLE opportunities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy to allow all operations for authenticated users
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON opportunities
--   FOR ALL
--   TO authenticated
--   USING (true)
--   WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create policy to allow all operations for anonymous users (if needed)
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for anonymous users" ON opportunities
--   FOR ALL
--   TO anon
--   USING (true)
--   WITH CHECK (true);

-- Also check other tables that might have RLS issues
ALTER TABLE hospitals DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE surgeons DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- If you have products and manufacturers tables
-- ALTER TABLE products DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE manufacturers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify the changes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('opportunities', 'hospitals', 'surgeons', 'users')
  AND schemaname = 'public';

-- Summary
SELECT 'RLS disabled for opportunities, hospitals, surgeons, and users tables' as status,
       'You should now be able to create opportunities without permission errors' as result;
